### Possible sources for Tamsy's preferred wool:
* Actually I found the exact company she wanted. Unfortunately: 
    a.) that sort of wool was a special run and 
    b.) that company is in Georgia, USA. 
* The website looks nice, though[^1]. 
* [Here](https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/lolabean-yarn-co-kidney-bean) it at least _still_ in the shop. On the other hand, the page wasn't updated since 2018. 
  
Discuss with Tamsy what other options we have....
