### Possible sources for knitting needles: 
* check Tamsy's preferred materiel. Apparently it is quite common to use bamboo, altough there are also ones made from aluminium, which I wouldn't really want, environoment-wise.
* there is a measurement called "needle size" ("Nadelst√§rke") in german. As far as i can tell, these are the "needle sizes" for the requested thickness:

| thickness 	| needle size 	|
|:---------:	|:-----------:	|
|    45mm   	|  3.00-3.25  	|
|    50mm   	|  3.50-3.75  	|
|    55mm   	|  3.75-4.00  	| [^1]
